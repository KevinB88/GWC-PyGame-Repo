pygame.PixelArray(screen)
creates a PixelArray object from the provided screen surface.

A 2-D interface is provided by the object which allows the modifications
of individual pixels within the space. Such that each pixel is accessed via its
x-y positions.

Modification of a pixel:

pixels[x_pos][y_pos] = (0->255, 0->255, 0->255)


# Rendering an animation to screen with pixels:

del pixels

after modification of a pixel the pixel array is deleted.

This is crucial since the pixel-array object locks the surface
preventing any outside operations from executing. This is the case
until the PixelArray is deleted or out of the scope.

********* Blitting *********

Blitting: the process of transferring pixels from one surface to another.
Essentially rendering an image onto another surface.
