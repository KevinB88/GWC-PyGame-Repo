    #**
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        pygame captures events: keyboard presses, mouse movements, window close button:
        these events are captured via an event-queue

        pygame.event.get():
        All events from the queue are retrieved.

        Within the loop we iterate/process each individual event available to us in the queue.

        With the condition: if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        pygame.QUIT is triggered when the user attempts to close the window.
        If this is the case then we set the flag to False, which halts the while loop,
        resulting in the whole program completely ending.
